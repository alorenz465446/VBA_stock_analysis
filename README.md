# VBA_stock_analysis

## Overview of Project

This analysis will show results for 12 "green stocks". The data will be analyzed by using VBA and Excel. The analysis will provide Total Daily Volume and the Return on these stocks in a given year. The stakeholder is also interested in seeing if runtime of the code can be decreased with refactoring. I will take the old code and add some refactoring to help the runtime of the program. 


## Results

The initial analysis showed a runtime of nearly two seconds. The refactored code ran significantly faster than the intial. Below are images of the results:

1.8125 - 0.2451172 = 1.5673828 

By taking the initial runtime and subtracting the refactored runtime, we see that the code ran a whole 1.6 seconds faster than before.

# Summary

## Refactoring : taking old code and replacing it with more efficient code 

### General Pros and Cons
* You are able to make a more efficient piece of work.

* Creating new problems in already working code can happen

### VBA Script Related Pros and Cons

* The code can be a lot smoother to read.

* Refactoring the code can be very time consuming.
